Introduction
------------
Elderly people tend to slip and fall in homes and remain unattended for a long time. 
If the affected person is not treated immediately, serious health issues including brain injuries occur. 
The proposed solution automatically detects humans falling, through cameras installed in homes, and sends notification to family members.
